# This is the less basic ReadMe file for the less basic things that I've made

This is what you'll want to read for anything not in "Basic Files"

It's not going to be as good or as pretty and will probably be much more rambly because that's how I am. But, if you contribute here then feel free to rewrite it. Or if you want to write a different one then I'm happy for that to happen. To edit this make a pull request here, and to edit actual code make one over on the Unity-Importables-Project page. 

# Animation
For times when you don't want to or can't use the default Unity animations. For me, I just can't get it to work most of the time and it's really annoying, so I made this! 
What you need to do:
 - Add the script to something you want to animate
 - Add some images to the sections
 - Add more images if needed by adding them in code
 - Add them to the animate function logic so that they all run in the right order
 - Add a way to change the "Animateing" bool from somewhere else. Add it to your player or something. When they're walking, call that and make it true so that the player animates. Make sure to get it from the player. 
 - Have fun with it. Make everything look nice and fun :)
 
 This might not be the most efficient way to do this, but I had to rewrite it because Unity stopped allowing Coroutines to be ran like functions and forced them from a "StartCoroutine" That screwed me over because I didn't know that existed and becuase it make too many and they overlapped instead of having one coroutine or function, I had 50. Per second. Plus. So it's now written better. This method probably wouldn't be as good if it was on a script with anything else, so it's a good job I was moving it over anyway.
